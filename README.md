## Description

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications to enable command and control (C2) of cyber defense systems and components. Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) is a schema and taxonomy for cyber security playbooks. The CACAO specification describes how these playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions. This extension builds on existing CACAO v2.0 OpenC2 support to improve modularity and utilize the current OpenC2 Transfer Specifications for MQTT (v1.0) and HTTPS (v1.1).
