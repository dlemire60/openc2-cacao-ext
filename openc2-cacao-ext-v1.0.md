#### Abstract:
Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) is a schema and taxonomy for cyber security playbooks. The CACAO specification describes how these playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions. This extension builds on existing CACAO v2.0 OpenC2 features to improve modularity and utilize the current OpenC2 Transfer Specifications for MQTT (v1.0) and HTTPS (v1.1).

# 3 OpenC2 Commands In CACAO

This section describes the implementation of OpenC2 commands under CACAO,
including the format and processing of an `openc2 ` command object, the handling
of base64 encoding and decoding, and the invocation of OpenC2 via `openc2`
command objects in a subordinate playbook.

This specification recommends deprecating CACAO's `openc2-http` command type in
favor of the transport-neutral `openc2` command type defined here, in keeping
with OpenC2's intent for the language to be defined in a transport-independent
manner.


## 3.1 OpenC2 Command Action Step

> NOTE: Copying in the `openc2-http` command from the CACAO v2.0 spec as a
> starting point

The `openc2` command represents a command that is intended to be processed via
an OpenC2 Consumer. The delivery of the command and specification of transfer
mechanism and desired OpenC2 AP are handled by defining appropriate CACAO agents
and targets. In addition to the inherited properties of a command object defined
in Section 5.1 of [[CACAO v2.0](#cacao-security-playbooks-v20)], this section
defines the following additional properties that are valid for this type.

The command type open vocabulary (`command-type-ov`) defined in Section 5.2 of
[[CACAO v2.0](#cacao-security-playbooks-v20)] is extended with the new value
`openc2`.

| **Property Name** | **Data Type** | **Details** |
|---|---|---|
| **type** (required) | `string` | The value of this property **must** be `openc2` |
| **command** (required) | `string` |  |
| **content_b64** (required) | `string` | An OpenC2 command that is base64 encoded (see Section 4 of [RFC 4649]). |
| **headers** (optional) | `dictionary` | This property contains headers to be passed to the OpenC2 agent providing message transfer functions. The key for each entry **MUST** be a `string` that uniquely identifies this header. The value for each key **MUST** be a `list` of `string`. |


**Example 3.1 (OpenC2 Command)**

```json
{
  "type": "openc2-http",
  "command": "POST /api1/newObjects/ HTTP/1.1",
  "content_b64": "ewogICJoZWFkZXJzIjogewogICAgInJlcXVlc3RfaWQiOiAiZDFhYzA0ODktZWQ1MS00MzQ1LTkxNzUtZjMwNzhmMzBhZmU1IiwKICAgICJjcmVhdGVkIjogMTU0NTI1NzcwMDAwMCwKICAgICJmcm9tIjogIm9jMnByb2R1Y2VyLmNvbXBhbnkubmV0IiwKICAgICJ0byI6IFsKICAgICAgIm9jMmNvbnN1bWVyLmNvbXBhbnkubmV0IgogICAgXQogIH0sCiAgImJvZHkiOiB7CiAgICAib3BlbmMyIjogewogICAgICAicmVxdWVzdCI6IHsKICAgICAgICAiYWN0aW9uIjogImRlbnkiLAogICAgICAgICJ0YXJnZXQiOiB7CiAgICAgICAgICAiaXB2NF9jb25uZWN0aW9uIjogewogICAgICAgICAgICAicHJvdG9jb2wiOiAidGNwIiwKICAgICAgICAgICAgInNyY19hZGRyIjogIjEuMi4zLjQiLAogICAgICAgICAgICAic3JjX3BvcnQiOiAxMDk5NiwKICAgICAgICAgICAgImRzdF9hZGRyIjogIjE5OC4yLjMuNCIsCiAgICAgICAgICAgICJkc3RfcG9ydCI6IDgwCiAgICAgICAgICB9CiAgICAgICAgfSwKICAgICAgICAiYXJncyI6IHsKICAgICAgICAgICJzdGFydF90aW1lIjogMTUzNDc3NTQ2MDAwMCwKICAgICAgICAgICJkdXJhdGlvbiI6IDUwMCwKICAgICAgICAgICJyZXNwb25zZV9yZXF1ZXN0ZWQiOiAiYWNrIiwKICAgICAgICAgICJzbHBmIjogewogICAgICAgICAgICAiZHJvcF9wcm9jZXNzIjogIm5vbmUiCiAgICAgICAgICB9CiAgICAgICAgfSwKICAgICAgICAicHJvZmlsZSI6ICJzbHBmIgogICAgICB9CiAgICB9CiAgfQp9",

command content is shown as text for illustration purposes only.

# 4 OpenC2 CACAO Agents and Targets

## 4.1 OpenC2 CACAO Agents

CACAO agents for OpenC2 correspond to OpenC2 transfer specifications. Each type of OpenC2 CACAO agent supports the use of one transfer protocol for sending OpenC2 commands and receiving OpenC2 responses.

### 4.1.1 MQTT Agents

### 4.1.2 HTTPS Agents

## 4.2 OpenC2 CACAO Targets

OpenC2 CACAO Targets correspond to OpenC2 Actuator Specifications.

> NOTE: determine what, if anything, needs to be defined beyond the correlation of APs and CACAO Targets.

> NOTE: provide examples of CACAO targets for OpenC2 APs

# 5 Conformance
<!-- Required section -->

(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.
For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause).

See "Guidelines to Writing Conformance Clauses":
